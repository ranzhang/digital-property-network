# Digital Property Network
**by Randy Zhang**

This is a blockchain-based network for digital property. Use the setDemo function to setup the demo resources. Users can register the property for transfer and transfer the ownership to another user. Events are generated for property transfer. 

There are some basic checks implemented: 
- Only the asset owner can register the asset for transfer 
- Only participants can issue or receive a transfer 
- Only the asset owner can transfer the ownership.
